    'how to analyze market trends': 'Analyze market trends by looking at price history, inventory levels, days on market, sales volume, employment rates, population growth, and new construction. Our platform provides comprehensive trend analysis for each city.',
    'what is market cycle': 'Real estate markets go through cycles: recovery, expansion, hyper supply, and recession. Understanding where a market is in its cycle helps time investments. Our AI identifies current market phases for each city.',

    'what is mortgage rate': 'Mortgage rates determine the cost of borrowing money for real estate. Rates are influenced by economic conditions, credit scores, and loan terms. Even small rate changes significantly impact monthly payments and affordability.',
    'what is debt to income ratio': 'Debt-to-income (DTI) ratio compares your monthly debt payments to gross monthly income. Lenders typically prefer DTI below 43% for conventional loans. Lower DTI ratios increase loan approval chances and better rates.',

    'how important are schools': 'School quality significantly impacts property values and rental demand. Properties in top-rated school districts typically appreciate faster and attract stable tenants. Families prioritize school quality when choosing neighborhoods.',
    'what is walkability': 'Walkability measures how easy it is to walk to amenities like shops, restaurants, parks, and transit. Higher walkability typically correlates with higher property values and rental demand, especially among younger demographics.',

Depreciation allows you to deduct property value decline over 27.5 years (residential) or 39 years (commercial), even if the property appreciates.

However, they're subject to market volatility unlike direct property ownership."

Cash reserves are crucial for weathering downturns."

Falling rates boost buying power and property values. Current rates around 7-8% are historically normal but feel high after years of low rates.
